Mod review of the Modloader edition v1.4 by Modification Station/The Zyga (thanks!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8lX9jv9lhI

The aim of this mod is to fix (major) annoyances or backport useful features that do not affect gameplay. List of fixes:

- Pickaxes are also effective against: furnaces, cobblestone stairs, bricks, redstone ore, iron doors, rails, dispensers, stone pressure plates and monster spawners
- Axes are also effective against: crafting tables, wooden slabs, wooden stairs, fences, wooden doors, ladders, signs, pumpkins, wooden pressure plates, jukeboxes and noteblocks
- Fences are placeable like normal
- Sugarcane is placeable on sand
- Stairs drop themselves
- Boats drop themselves
- Bookshelves drop three books
- Boats don't break due to high velocity
- Never fall through boats anymore when getting out
- Pick block (middle mouse button click) works for blocks that are in the player's inventory, but not in their hotbar
- Pick block also works on: paintings, minecarts (all three types), wooden doors, iron doors, signs, crops, redstone repeaters, redstone wire, beds, piston heads and cake
- Repair armor and tools
- Flowing lava now disappears when lava source block is removed
- Also: most fixes are toggleable!

To use pick block: Look at something and click your scroll wheel. If it's in your inventory, it will automatically be selected.
