**This version of the mod now supports multiplayer!**
- Use GlassConfigAPI version 2.0+ to set up the config.
- The mod showcase video has also been updated: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-NnpTYiuZc

The aim of this mod is to fix (major) annoyances or backport useful features that do not affect gameplay. List of fixes:

- Pickaxes are also effective against: furnaces, cobblestone stairs, bricks, redstone ore, iron doors, rails, dispensers, stone pressure plates, and monster spawners
- Axes are also effective against: crafting tables, wooden slabs (experimental), wooden stairs, fences, wooden doors, ladders, signs, pumpkins, wooden pressure plates, jukeboxes, and noteblocks
- Fences are placeable like normal and bounding box was minimized when appropriate
- Stairs drop themselves
- Bookshelves drop three books
- Pigs drop their saddles if they have a saddle equipped
- Boats drop themselves
- Boats don't break due to high velocity (or drop boat, or vanilla, toggle with config)
- Never fall through boats anymore when getting out
- Logout/login with vehicle (no longer exit vehicle upon logout)
- Pick block (middle mouse button click) works for blocks that are in the player's inventory, but not in their hotbar
- Pick block also works on: paintings, minecarts (all three types), wooden doors, iron doors, signs, crops, redstone repeaters, redstone wire, beds, piston heads and cake
- Add missing wooden items as fuel sources in furnace: wooden tools, wooden doors, boats, bowls, signs, and ladders
- Repair armor and tools
- Flint and steel does not lose durability if fire fails to ignite
- Flowing lava now disappears when lava source block is removed
- Chicken bounding box was increased to modern Minecraft bounding box size
- Water spring propagation has been fixed: https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1283147-water-spring-propagation-fix
- Also: almost all fixes are toggleable!
  - Note: There is currently a bug with GlassConfigAPI where integer settings need to be saved twice

To use pick block: Look at something and click your scroll wheel. If it's in your inventory, it will automatically be selected.
- On multiplayer pick block can only search the hotbar for the item
